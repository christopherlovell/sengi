A small, fast, interactive viewer for Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) spectra, using Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) and bilinear interpolation for reconstruction.

A live demo is available at [https://christopherlovell.github.io/sengi](christopherlovell.github.io/sengi)

_Health Warning_

Because of the nature of the NMF reconstruction the spectra generated by Sengi will not be exact. We show in the associated paper that the accuracy is sufficient for prototyping and education purposes, however for science purposes the original models should *always* be used.

## Contributions
If you find any bugs, or wish to make a feature request, please submit an issue.

## Models
A full description of each of the SPS models used is provided [here](https://www.christopherlovell.co.uk/sengi/models.html).

## Citation

A scientific paper detailing the NMF and interpolation method will be published soon.
